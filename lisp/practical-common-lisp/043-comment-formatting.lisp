;;;; Four semicolons are used for a file header comment.

;;; A comment with three semicolons will usually be a paragraph
;;; comment that applies to a large section of code that follows,

(defun foo (x)
  (dotimes (i x)
    ;; Two semicolons indicate this comment applies to the code
    ;; that follows. Note that this comment is indented the same
    ;; as the code that follows.
    (format t "foo~%")       ; this comment applies to this line only
    (format t "bar~%")))     ; and this is for this line

(foo 3)
