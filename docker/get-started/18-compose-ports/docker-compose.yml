# The netstat -t output shows that the container has received a connection
# from 10.255.0.2 when we visited the Python HTTP server.
# It appears to be an IP address managed by Docker. The container can
# ping this IP address successfully.

# Note that there are no port mappings on the container. The port
# mappings are only on the service. Compare this with the example in
# 12-python-http.sh where the port mapping is on the container.

# Running ifconfig in the container shows three interfaces apart from lo:
#
#   - eth0: 10.255.0.58
#   - eth1: 172.18.0.3
#   - eth2: 10.0.0.4
