\section*{Problem}
Two perfect logicians, S and P, are told that integers \( x \) and \( y \)
have been chosen such that \( 1 < x < y \) and \( x + y < 100 \). S is
given the value \( x + y \) and P is given the value \( xy \). They then
have the following conversation.

P:  I cannot determine the two numbers. \\
S:  I knew that. \\
P:  Now I can determine them. \\
S:  So can I.

Given that the above statements are true, what are the two numbers?

\section*{Solution}
This problem is solved using a computer program written in Python. The
program and its output, respectively, are available at the following

\item \url{https://github.com/sunainapai/lab/blob/master/lab/nick/003.txt}
\end{itemize}

The output shows that the solution is \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 13 \).
